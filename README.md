Next.js Course Playground – My Learning Summary
This repository reflects everything I learned from the first part of Mosh Hamedani’s Next.js course. Through this course, I gained hands-on experience building full-stack applications using Next.js 13+ (App Router) and TypeScript.

Here’s what I learned and implemented:

Styling modern Next.js applications for clean, responsive UIs

Setting up and managing routing/navigation using the new App Router

Building robust APIs with Next.js

Integrating a database into my projects using Prisma

Handling file uploads within the app

Implementing user authentication using NextAuth.js with both OAuth and credentials

Sending beautifully styled emails directly from the app

Optimizing the application for performance and SEO

Deploying Next.js apps to production

Debugging and troubleshooting common errors
